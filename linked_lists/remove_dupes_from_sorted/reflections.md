# Thoughts on My Solution to This Problem

After submitting the code in `solution.rb` on Leetcode, I discovered that my code had a runtime of 92ms. At time of writing, this beat just 55.88% of submissions on Leetcode for this problem. My code also took up 211 MB of memory. At time of writing, this actually beat 90.20% of submissions on Leetcode. So my solution does well in terms of memory allocation but is pretty average in terms of runtime.
